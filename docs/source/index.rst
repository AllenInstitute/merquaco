merquaco
====================================
**merquaco** is a tool for assessing the quality of spatial transcriptomics experiments on the Vizgen MERSCOPE platform.
merquaco computes a range of metrics to assess transcript detection efficiency in space, tissue integrity, and
deviations from ideal perfusion flow rate using the transcripts table, codebook, DAPI image, and perfusion log file.
All analyses ignore cell segmentation boundaries and only use information pertaining to transcript locations.
